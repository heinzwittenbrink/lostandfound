[Ex- Apache Chairman Makes Java JCR Prediction (SYS-CON)](http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=46442&de=1): The Apache Software Foundation's former chairman, Roy Fielding, now Day's lead scientist, has joined the project in a mentoring capacity; as well as acting as Apache's representative in its Incubator project management committee... Fielding surmises that JCR will become as ubiquitous as HTTP/1.1, used by everyone accessing the Web. He was a co-founder of the first Apache Project and authored the Internet standards for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Ist das nur Marketing-Modus? Fieldings Reputation spricht dagegen. Zu [Jackrabbit](http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/) und [Atom](http://www.atomenabled.org/) siehe [dieses Mail](http://www.mail-archive.com/atom-syntax@mail.imc.org/msg01394.html) Fieldings an die Atom-Syntax-Liste.
