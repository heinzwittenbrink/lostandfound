[Dave Winer](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/03/02#anotherTotallyObviousFactoid): Okay, we don't know for a [fact](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=factoid) that Google is working on an operating system, but the tea leaves are pretty damned clear. Why else would they have hired Microsoft's operating system architect, [Mark Lucovsky](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?FORM=MSNH&srch_type=0&q=Mark+Lucovsky)? Surely not to write a spreadsheet or word processor.
