Chris Dent über [erste Erfahrungen mit dem Atom Publishing Protocol](http://www.burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt/archives/000423.html):

> Sure, there are lots of Weblog APIs, but none in my experience has the comfy feel had by Atom in the wild. Atom is complicated and you can feel it, but you can also feel that it could end up doing some fun stuff in a clean way that brings the web another step closer to being a big storehouse of knowledge reusable (not just usable) by anyone.
