[Mark Hamilton](http://www.tamark.ca/students/?p=1759):

> In my experience, as much as the journalism school I teach at is siloed and as conservative as most newsrooms, the students are siloed. They're still caught up in old media models, too.

Gefunden bei [What is the difference between TV, radio, and newspapers?](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/10/21.html#a1326), in dem Jon Udell sehr prägnant formuliert, wie das Netz den Journalismus (technisch) verändert:

> Yes, the methods of content delivery are merging into a single stream. But more profoundly for people working in the various media professions, three formerly distinct skill sets are coming together. It's true that radio and TV people have always had to be competent writers, but print folk have not traditionally had to be competent editors of audio and video, or competent performers.
