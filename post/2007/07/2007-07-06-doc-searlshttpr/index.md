[Doc Searls](http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2007/07/sap-global-su-1.html "Global Neighbourhoods: SAP Global Survey: Doc Searls"):

> I've said "Web 2.0 is what we'll call the next crash," as well as the current bubble. and I still believe that. Social Media as a "meme" may sink with the same boat. The more useful distinction is between the Live Web and the Static Web. The Live Web today is branching off of the Static Web.

Ausf√ºhrliches Interview mit Doc Searls. Interessant unter anderem wegen der Kritik am Medienbegriff und den Bemerkungen zum "zeitlichen" Charakter des Web.
