Besser als Michael Sippey kann man kaum sagen, was _Social Media Literacy_ ist:

> In short, "media literacy" was focused on creating smarter media consumers; understanding how media's produced and distributed, the biases behind it, etc. (See also deconstructionism, etc.) "Social media literacy," on the other hand, needs to be focused on creating smarter media producers, who understand the ramifications of a hyper-connected zero-cost-of-distribution world. \[[this is sippey.typepad.com: jason fortuny and social media literacy](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/08/jason-fortuny-and-social-media-literacy.html "this is sippey.typepad.com: jason fortuny and social media literacy")\]
