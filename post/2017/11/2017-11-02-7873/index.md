Had a great session on technical markup quality with #cos17. I started it sitting in a kitchen in Venice. Then for technical reasons I had to ask [@Lief\_Erickson](https://twitter.com/Lief_Erickson?lang=de) in Minneapolis to continue hosting it. I am still astonished that learning and teaching has become so independent from locations, but even more that the quality of the input of the distributed class was so high.
