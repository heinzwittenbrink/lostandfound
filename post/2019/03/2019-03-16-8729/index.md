[Tim Berners-Lee on 30 years of the world wide web: 'We can get the web we want'](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/12/tim-berners-lee-on-30-years-of-the-web-if-we-dream-a-little-we-can-get-the-web-we-want)

For me the web provides the foundations of #contentstrategy, it is not an output channel. Without the web content couldnâ€˜t connect large sets of digital touchpoints.
