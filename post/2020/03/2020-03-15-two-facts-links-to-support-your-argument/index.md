Two facts/links to support your argument (probably you know them already): - _Climate Change_ has been the preferred term of right wing propagandists (Frank Luntz) because it sounds less dangerous than _global warming_: [They didn't change the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change'](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-change-global-warming-basic.html "They didn't change the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change'"). - Concerning Naomi Seibt: About her relationship to the Heartland Institute see: [Exposé Shows Rise of Heartland Institute’s Climate Denial Efforts Overseas, Using Dark Money and a YouTuber | DeSmog](https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/02/20/heartland-institute-climate-denial-germany-naomi-seibt-correctiv "Exposé Shows Rise of Heartland Institute’s Climate Denial Efforts Overseas, Using Dark Money and a YouTuber | DeSmog").
