Just read [Marketing as Control of Human Interfaces and Its Political Exploitation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-019-00374-7 "Marketing as Control of Human Interfaces and Its Political Exploitation | SpringerLink"). Great, elucidating a lot and helpful to understand the possible relationship of content strategy to content marketing. (Also helful for [XR](https://rebellion.earth/extinction-rebellion-uk-2020/ "Home - Extinction Rebellion").) Have to reread it and make better use of my Latourian glasses.
